# Python → Swift migration record

This document tracks the rewrite of iOS Developer Toolkit from the PySide6 / `pymobiledevice3`
application (v0.3.4) to a native Swift/SwiftUI macOS application. It is the working checklist
for the migration and is updated as each feature is migrated, tested, and verified.

Status legend: ✅ migrated and verified end to end (real simulator, real Xcode tools, or the app
itself) · 🟡 migrated and tested against the protocol-accurate fake device or recorded tool output;
needs physical-device verification · 🔁 replaced by a different Apple-supported mechanism · ❌ not
migrated (see §6) or removed

> The Python app is not discontinued: it continues as **iOS Developer Toolkit** in
> [hideouts-io/iOS-Developer-Toolkit](https://github.com/hideouts-io/iOS-Developer-Toolkit). This document covers how its features map to
> this Swift app, **iOS Developer Toolkit (Swift)**.

## 1. Audit of the Python application (v0.3.4)

### 1.1 Repository inventory

| Area | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GUI | `ios_developer_toolkit/app.py` (7,795 lines), `gui_pages.py`, `live_logs.py` (pop-out windows), `action_palette.py`, `operation_history.py` | PySide6 widgets, 13 workspaces, QProcess controllers |
| Entry points | `__main__.py`, `entrypoint.py`, `packaging/main.py`, `macos/iOSDeveloperToolkit` launcher | Frozen-runtime dispatch for internal workers and the embedded `pymobiledevice3` CLI |
| CLI tools | `collector.py` (`ios-developer-collect`), `local_ddi.py` (`ios-local-ddi`), `ipa_inspector.py` (`ios-ipa-inspect`) | argparse-based |
| Device access | Every device operation shells out to the `pymobiledevice3` CLI (pinned 11.15.1) | No in-process protocol code |
| Process control | `qt_process.py`, `interactive_process.py`, `backup_process.py`, `collection_process.py`, `capability_matrix_worker.py` | Five separate QProcess lifecycle controllers |
| External providers | `external_tools.py` (go-ios, idb, ipsw), `mvt_connector.py`, `ufade_connector.py` | User-installed executables validated by path + SHA-256 |
| Pure logic | `command_catalog.py`, `catalog.py`, `action_safety.py`, `location_lab.py`, `installed_apps.py`, `case_workflow.py`, `device_compatibility.py`, `workspace_profile.py`, `support_bundle.py`, `connection_diagnostics.py`, `command_drift.py`, `demo_mode.py`, `validation.py`, `file_integrity.py`, `models.py`, `runtime.py`, `xcode_handoff.py` | Ported feature-by-feature |
| Tests | `tests/` — 17 unittest modules (133 tests) + a 138-button GUI smoke test inside `entrypoint.py` | Used as the behavioural reference for the Swift tests |
| Packaging | `scripts/build_macos_release.sh` (Nuitka), `packaging/pysidedeploy.spec`, `macos/Info.plist`, `scripts/verify_*.py`, `scripts/collect_third_party_licenses.py` | Nuitka-frozen Python bundle, ad-hoc signed |
| CI | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `frozen-macos-smoke.yml`, `release-macos.yml`, `docs.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `dependabot.yml` | Python-based |
| Docs | `README.md` (1,224 lines), `docs/*.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, 22 screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` | Heavily `pymobiledevice3`-specific |
| Assets | `assets/iosdevtoolkit.png` (logo), `assets/location-world-map.png` (Natural Earth, public domain), `macos/iOSDeveloperToolkit.icns` | Reused |
| Config | `pyproject.toml`, `requirements/docs.txt`, `requirements/release-sbom.txt`, `.gitignore` | |

Secrets scan: no private keys, tokens, or credentials are committed.

### 1.2 Privilege model

The Python application never used `sudo`. Discovery polled `pymobiledevice3 usbmux list` every
3 seconds (a Python process launch per poll). The Swift version keeps the no-privilege model
and replaces polling with usbmuxd's `Listen` event stream.

### 1.3 go-ios and blacktop/ipsw

Both were **optional, user-installed adapters** in the *Ecosystem Tools* workspace
(`external_tools.py`). Each adapter validated an executable and ran exactly one read-only probe
(`ios list --details`, `ipsw idev list`). No other feature depended on them. Both adapters,
their tests, documentation, GUI tab, smoke-test steps, and README/third-party notice entries
are removed. Their only capability — listing connected devices — is covered natively by the
Swift device discovery (usbmuxd + CoreDevice + simctl), so nothing is lost.

## 2. Feature inventory and migration map

`pmd3` = `pymobiledevice3`. "Native lockdown" = the Swift usbmuxd/lockdown client in
`DeviceKit` (no external tools). "CoreDevice" = Apple's `xcrun devicectl` JSON interface.

## 3. Architecture decisions

1. **SwiftUI app + Swift Package libraries.** Logic lives in a Swift package (`Package.swift`)
   so it builds and tests with `swift test` and in Xcode. The app target
   (`iOSDeveloperToolkit.xcodeproj`, generated from `project.yml` with XcodeGen and committed)
   contains only SwiftUI views and view state.
2. **Modules.**
   - `ToolkitCore` — logging (`OSLog` categories), `ToolkitError` (user message + technical
     detail + recovery suggestion), the single `CommandRunner` (the only place that creates a
     `Process`), secure file helpers (owner-only, no-overwrite, atomic), hashing, sanitizer,
     operation journal.
   - `DeviceKit` — device models and plain-language explanations, usbmuxd client, lockdown
     client, lockdown services, CoreDevice (`devicectl`) client, simulator (`simctl`) client,
     discovery coordinator, capability probes.
   - `ToolkitFeatures` — Location Lab, IPA inspection, live-log capture/findings, evidence
     collection, workspace profiles, support bundle, compatibility history, action safety.
   - `idt` — command-line tool.
3. **Physical devices use two Apple paths.** CoreDevice (`devicectl`, Xcode ≥ 15) for developer
   services on iOS 17+ (it owns the RemoteXPC tunnel and personalized DDI); and a native Swift
   usbmuxd/lockdown client for services available to any trusted device without Xcode
   (identity, syslog, os_trace_relay, pcapd, MobileBackup2, diagnostics, installation proxy,
   misagent, image mounter). Pair records are read through usbmuxd's `ReadPairRecord`, which
   macOS allows without root. The app never creates pair records, never reads
   `/var/db/lockdown`, and never uses `sudo`.
4. **TLS for lockdown uses swift-nio-ssl.** Lockdown upgrades an established plaintext stream
   to TLS with the pair record's host certificate. Network.framework has no public STARTTLS
   and SecureTransport has been deprecated since macOS 10.15, so the lockdown channel uses
   Apple's open-source `swift-nio` + `swift-nio-ssl` (Apache-2.0). The device certificate is
   pinned to the `DeviceCertificate` stored in the pair record.
5. **Event-driven discovery.** usbmuxd `Listen` pushes attach/detach events; CoreDevice and
   simulator lists refresh on those events, on explicit refresh, and on a slow (30 s) timer only
   for network-only CoreDevice devices that usbmuxd cannot report.
6. **Device targeting.** Every operation takes an immutable `DeviceTarget` (kind + UDID +
   display name) captured when the operation starts; operations never read "the current
   selection" later. Device-changing actions require a phrase bound to the target's UDID.
7. **Minimum macOS 14** (Observation, modern SwiftUI). Universal binary (arm64 + x86_64).
8. **Swift 6 language mode** with strict concurrency.

## 4. Removed dependencies

| Dependency | Reason |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10–3.13 runtime, PySide6, Nuitka | Replaced by native Swift/SwiftUI app |
| `pymobiledevice3` 11.15.1 (and its transitive deps: xonsh, IPython, etc.) | Replaced by native lockdown client + Apple CoreDevice/simctl/xctrace |
| go-ios adapter | Removed by request |
| blacktop/ipsw adapter | Removed by request |
| mkdocs-material, cyclonedx-bom (Python) | Docs moved into repository Markdown; SBOM generated from `Package.resolved` |

## 5. Test results

Environment: MacBook Pro (Apple silicon), macOS 27.0, Xcode 27.0 (Swift 6.4). One iPhone
(iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26.3.1, locked, Developer Mode off) was connected on 2026-09-27 for the
read-only checks in §5.4; nothing that changes a device was run on it.

### 5.1 Automated tests

| Suite | Tests | What it exercises | Result |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `ToolkitCoreTests` | 30 | `CommandRunner` (argument vectors, timeouts, cancellation, output draining, minimal environment), `ToolkitError`, secure file I/O (owner-only, no overwrite, path traversal), sanitizer, hashing, journal, ZIP writer | ✅ pass |
| `DeviceKitTests` | 85 | usbmuxd framing and `Listen` events, developer images (image mounter, image library, TSS request, state evaluation, personalized and legacy mount/unmount), pairing-record handling, lockdown TLS with certificate pinning and UDID check, the lockdown service clients (syslog, os_trace incl. the process list, pcapd, MobileBackup2, diagnostics, installation proxy, AFC, image mounter, springboard, MCInstall, Web Inspector, Bluetooth PacketLogger) against an in-process **fake usbmuxd + lockdownd device**; CoreDevice JSON parsing; `simctl` parsing | ✅ pass |
| `ToolkitFeaturesTests` | 72 | Location Lab, GPX, route waypoints, location mechanism routing and legacy-service message encoding, provisioning profiles (misagent) and packet capture through the action executor, IPA inspection (fixtures incl. malicious archives), live-log capture/findings/register/export, action catalog and safety policy, actions and readiness against the fake device (incl. the Web Inspector and Instruments rows and slow Xcode tools), evidence collection and its prerequisites, workspace profiles incl. 0.3.x import, guided reconnect, keyboard navigation, support bundle, external-tool validation (incl. UFADE's submodule) | ✅ pass |
| Real simulator (opt-in, `IDT_SIMULATOR_TESTS=1`) | 1 | Boots an iOS 26.3.1 iPhone simulator; waits for boot to complete; sets, routes, and clears location; screenshot; app list; live unified log capture with hash; launches an app; Open URL action; readiness; compiles, installs, lists, launches, and uninstalls a minimal simulator app | ✅ pass locally (about 24 s) |
| Real device (opt-in, `IDT_DEVICE_TESTS=1`) | 4 | Read-only protocol checks against a connected iPhone or iPad (§5.4) | ✅ pass on one iPhone (2026-09-27) |
| XCUITest smoke tests (`App/UITests`) | 8 | Window size, Demo Mode labelling, every workspace, disabled demo actions, command palette, Location Lab validation, minimum size, developer-image card | ✅ the original 7 pass locally (2026-09-27, run by the maintainer). The first run failed `testDemoActionsAreBlockedWithExplanation`: each Actions row exposed its identifier on three child elements, so the click was ambiguous (and VoiceOver read three items). Rows are now single accessibility elements; the three affected tests were re-run and pass. All 8 (including the developer-image card test added in §8) pass in CI on Xcode 26.6 (PR #13), also after the parity work (`25ef72c`). A local run by the maintainer after the parity work (2026-09-27): 7 of 8 pass, including the developer-image card; `testEveryWorkspaceOpens` could not click the sidebar because another app's window covered it (XCTest reported the overlapping windows). Re-run alone with a clear screen, it passes, so all 8 pass locally. |

Totals: 187 package tests pass with `-warnings-as-errors` (6 opt-in tests skipped); the app and
UI-test targets build with `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES` and zero warnings. The UI added after
the parity audit (reconnect guide, shortcut reference, Advanced Mode prefill, readiness status,
profile import) is verified through the screenshot harness and unit tests, not by XCUITests.

### 5.2 GUI verification

The app's screenshot harness (`-capture-screenshots`, see `scripts/check-layout.sh`) rendered all
14 workspaces in Demo Mode at 1180×700 (default) and 900×560 (minimum): no page is squeezed or
overflows the window. The same harness rendered the Device, Live Logs (real simulator log stream,
about 35,000 lines in 6 s), Location Lab, and Actions pages with a booted simulator. The README
screenshots come from these renders.

### 5.3 Release packaging

`scripts/build-release.sh` produced a universal (arm64 + x86_64) app, ad-hoc signed with the
hardened runtime (`flags=0x10002(adhoc,runtime)`), with `idt`, dependency licenses, and the SPDX
SBOM inside, and verified it again from the ZIP. The release build launched and rendered, and its
`idt` listed devices. After Rosetta 2 was installed (2026-09-27), the x86_64 slices were run under
Rosetta: the release script's check ran the Intel `idt`; the Intel `idt` listed devices, found all
27 Xcode routes, and reported developer-image status; the Intel app rendered all 14 pages at both
window sizes without layout problems; and all 187 package tests pass when built for x86_64 and run
with `arch -x86_64 xctest` (re-run after the parity work). This is Rosetta on Apple silicon, not a real Intel Mac. `spctl`
rejects the app, as expected for an app that is not notarized.

### 5.4 Physical devices

**Partly tested on hardware (2026-09-27).** One iPhone 17 Pro (`iPhone18,1`) on iOS 26.3.1, on USB,
trusted, **locked, with Developer Mode off**. The native protocol layer was checked with the
opt-in, read-only suite `RealDeviceTests` (`IDT_DEVICE_TESTS=1 swift test --filter RealDeviceTests`)
and `idt`. The GUI protocol in
[docs/PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEST_PROTOCOL.md](docs/PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEST_PROTOCOL.md) has not been run. Nothing
that changes the device was run: no mounting, location, installation, or backup.

| Check | Service | Result on the iPhone |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery, TLS session, UDID match | usbmuxd, lockdown | ✅ |
| Process list | `os_trace_relay` `PidList` | ✅ 519 processes, including launchd |
| Configuration profiles | `com.apple.mobile.MCInstall` | ✅ 2 profiles |
| Provisioning profiles | `misagent` | ✅ 3 profiles |
| Installed apps | `installation_proxy` | ✅ 462 apps |
| Diagnostics | `diagnostics_relay` | ✅ |
| Mounted images | `mobile_image_mounter` lookup | ✅ none mounted (correct: Developer Mode off) |
| Developer image state | evaluator | ✅ *Needs attention: Developer Mode is off* (the row's advice now says to turn on Developer Mode instead of the generic “Mount Developer Image”). With Developer Mode assumed on, the evaluator selects Xcode image 27A266a's `iPhone18,1` identity (*Personalization required*) |
| Classic syslog | `syslog_relay` | ✅ 3,476 lines in 4 s |
| Unified Logging | `os_trace_relay` | ✅ 15,535 records in 4 s |
| Packet capture | `pcapd` | ✅ 27 packets in 5 s, valid `.pcap` |
| Bluetooth capture | `BTPacketLogger` | ◐ service starts, 0 records (no Bluetooth logging profile installed) |
| Safari and web view tabs | `webinspector` | ◐ not answering (Web Inspector presumably off); the refusal message was shown |
| Instruments | `xctrace list devices` | ✅ device listed as available |
| CoreDevice | `devicectl` | ✅ connected, tunnel connected |

| Device | iOS | Connection | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 | Tester, date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| iPhone 17 Pro | 26.3.1 | USB | discovery and trust | protocol layer (above), repeated after the parity work; `idt readiness`; every app page rendered with the phone selected, including the Readiness Check and the app list (462 apps with sizes) — interactive steps (live-log controls, exports, packet-capture action) not run | not run (Developer Mode off) | not run | maintainer, 2026-09-27 |

### 5.5 Final verification (2026-09-27)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Fresh clone of `swift-native-migration` to a temporary folder; `swift build -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`; `swift test` | ✅ builds with no warnings; 147 tests pass |
| Clean `xcodebuild … clean build-for-testing` of the app and UI tests | ✅ succeeded. It exposed 78 Swift 6 actor-isolation warnings in the UI tests that a plain `build` never compiles and that `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` does not promote; fixed, and CI now fails on any warning in the build log |
| Launch and render every screen | ✅ all 14 pages at 1180×700 and 900×560 (Demo Mode, `scripts/check-layout.sh`), and all 14 with a booted iOS 26.3.1 simulator selected and its live log streaming |
| Nothing requires Python | ✅ no Python in the repository except the optional, user-installed UFADE and MVT integrations (Python programs themselves); the release script fails if a binary links Python; the build, tests, SBOM generator, and release script use only Xcode |
| `idt devices`, `idt toolchain` | ✅ no devices → guidance and exit 0; simulators listed with `--simulators`; all 27 `devicectl`/`simctl`/`xctrace` routes present in Xcode 27.0 |
| Real simulator end-to-end (`IDT_SIMULATOR_TESTS=1`) | ✅ passed (9.6 s) |
| No Xcode (simulated with `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`) | ✅ usbmuxd discovery still works; CoreDevice and simulators report "Xcode is not installed…"; the app's sidebar shows them as Unavailable. The Toolchain Check blamed each individual command; fixed to report the missing Xcode (exit 2) |
| usbmuxd missing | ✅ the app (discovery pointed at a nonexistent socket) shows USB & Wi-Fi as Unavailable with the reason in the tooltip; the library error names usbmuxd (tested) |
| No device | ✅ Overview shows "No device selected" with next steps; `idt devices` explains how to connect |
| Unified log review | ✅ subsystem `io.hideouts.iOSDeveloperToolkit` logs discovery, commands (start/finish, duration, status), and outcomes; errors seen were the tests' deliberate negative cases. Found and fixed: default command names could put a simulator UDID in a public field, and some error descriptions and operation titles (paths, app names) were public |
| Default window on a 1280×800 display | ✅ first launch opens at 1180×700 including title bar and toolbar (minimum 900×612), within the ~1280×705 usable area below the menu bar with a bottom Dock |
| README matches the app | ✅ menus, shortcuts, pages, labels, `idt` options and exit codes, file locations, and the with/without-Xcode table checked against the code; the no-Xcode column was checked against the implementation (native lockdown paths) |
| Physical iPhone/iPad | ◐ read-only protocol checks passed on one iPhone (§5.4); the app's pages, mounting, location, installation, backup, and multi-device handling are **untested on hardware** |
| After the parity work (§9) | ✅ `swift test -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`: 187 pass; clean `xcodebuild … clean build-for-testing`: zero compiler warnings; `scripts/check-layout.sh`: 14 pages at both sizes; `scripts/build-release.sh`: passes; x86_64 tests under Rosetta: 187 pass; real simulator end-to-end: passes |

## 6. Known limitations and features not reproduced

### 6.1 Features not migrated

| Feature (Python) | Why not in 1.0 | Alternatives investigated | Native implementation possible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Safari/WebView tab listing** (`pmd3 webinspector opened-tabs`) | ✅ Implemented after the parity audit (§9 G3): native `com.apple.webinspector` client, retrying refusals until a deadline. Opening a URL through Web Inspector (automation) is still not reproduced — it needs a WebDriver session and Safari’s Remote Automation setting; Open URL uses CoreDevice. | — | — |
| **Bluetooth HCI capture** (`pmd3 btlogger`) | ✅ Implemented after the parity audit (§9 G4): native `com.apple.bluetooth.BTPacketLogger` client; records are written as Apple PacketLogger `.pklg` (opened by PacketLogger and Wireshark) instead of 0.3.x's pcapng. Needs Apple's Bluetooth logging profile on the device. | — | — |
| **DVT file-system listing** (`pmd3 developer dvt ls`) | DVT uses Apple's private DTX protocol (NSKeyedArchiver messages over `com.apple.instruments.remoteserver*`). On iOS 17+ it is only reachable through the RemoteXPC tunnel that CoreDevice owns; creating that tunnel needs a utun interface (root) or CoreDevice's private frameworks — both excluded (no `sudo`, no private frameworks). | AFC (`com.apple.afc`, Media folder — implemented as *List Media folder*); `devicectl device info files` and `device copy from` for app containers and supported domains (available through Advanced Mode); crash reports through `crashreportcopymobile` (implemented). | **Not for iOS 17+** without privileges or private frameworks. For iOS 16 and earlier, DTX over lockdown is possible but serves only legacy devices and is not planned. |

### 6.2 Verification gaps

- **Developer images** (§8): the image-mounter protocol and Apple personalization are verified
  against a stateful fake image mounter and a fake signing server, and the request is built from
  the real image Xcode installed on this Mac. No device has mounted an image through this code yet.
- **Native lockdown services need more physical-device verification.** The read-only services
  answered correctly on one iPhone (§5.4); Web Inspector and Bluetooth logging were reached but
  returned nothing (setting and profile not present). usbmuxd, lockdown TLS, and all
  service clients pass byte-level tests against the fake device, which reproduces Apple's framing
  (plist headers, TLS upgrade, DeviceLink, AFC packets, pcapd records, os_trace records) from
  public protocol documentation and prior implementations. Real devices can differ in details
  (record versions, error codes, timing). Until the protocol in §5.4 has been run, treat 🟡 rows
  as unverified.
- **CoreDevice commands** are verified for argument construction, JSON parsing (from recorded
  output shapes), and presence in the installed Xcode (Toolchain Check), not against a device.
- **UI tests** run in CI and when the maintainer runs them locally (macOS asks once to allow UI
  automation); all 8 pass in both.
- **Intel Macs:** the x86_64 slice is verified under Rosetta 2 on Apple silicon (tests, CLI, and
  rendering), not on Intel hardware.
- **CI** (PR #13, `macos-26`, Xcode 26.6 / Swift 6.3.3): the app build with the zero-warning check,
  all 8 UI tests, the layout check, and dependency review pass. Two fixes came out of the first
  runs: an array-type inference difference in Swift 6.3 (test code), and waiting for simulators to
  finish booting (`simctl bootstatus -b`) before launching apps. Later fixes: a race in the fake
  device's TLS start (intermittent package-test timeout), `@main` in a file named `main.swift`
  (rejected by Swift 6.3 in the universal release build; the file is now `IDT.swift`), and Xcode
  tool probes that time out on a busy runner (now “did not answer in time”, not “Xcode missing”).
- **Older Xcode:** Xcode 26.6 (the CI runner) lacks `devicectl device simulate location`, the
  screenshot `--destination` option, `device process openURL`, and `device profile list --type`.
  With Xcode 26, location simulation on iOS 17+ and those actions through Xcode's device service are
  unavailable; the app says so (“needs a newer Xcode”) and the Toolchain Check lists them. Native
  replacements now avoid `devicectl` for the process list and configuration profiles over USB (§9
  G1, G2). The app is verified with Xcode 27.

### 6.3 Behaviour differences from 0.3.x

- Release builds are universal instead of separate Apple silicon and Intel downloads (kept after
  macOS 27 began warning that Intel code run under Rosetta will not open in macOS 28); minimum
  macOS is 14 (was 13).
- Guided actions replace the 49 raw `pymobiledevice3` presets; Advanced Mode runs `devicectl`
  instead of arbitrary `pymobiledevice3` subcommands.
- DVT telemetry streams are replaced by Instruments recordings (`xctrace`). The DVT OSLog stream is
  replaced by DVT Logging, a timed Instruments Logging recording shown line by line; the live
  Unified Logging stream needs no developer image, and the OSLog Archive adds the saved history.
- Features that need a developer tunnel (iOS 17+) now require Xcode, which owns the tunnel.

- 2026-09-27 — First hardware pass (read-only, one iPhone, §5.4) and opt-in `RealDeviceTests`.

## 8. Developer image (DDI) audit and restoration

### 8.1 What the Python app did (0.3.4, via `pymobiledevice3` 11.15.1)

| Path | Python behaviour |
|---|---|
| “Mount Personalized DDI” (default) | `pymobiledevice3 mounter auto-mount`. **iOS ≤ 16:** download `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg` + `.signature` for the device's `major.minor` from the third-party GitHub mirror `doronz88/DeveloperDiskImage`, `ReceiveBytes` (ImageType `Developer`) + `MountImage` over `com.apple.mobile.mobile_image_mounter`, mounted at `/Developer`. **iOS ≥ 17:** download `Image.dmg`, `Image.dmg.trustcache`, `BuildManifest.plist` (Xcode's personalized DDI) from the same mirror into `~/.pymobiledevice3`; `QueryPersonalizationManifest` (SHA-384 of the image) to reuse a manifest the device already holds, otherwise `QueryPersonalizationIdentifiers` + `QueryNonce` and an Apple TSS request (`gs.apple.com`) for an `ApImg4Ticket`; then `ReceiveBytes`/`MountImage` with ImageType `Personalized` and the trust cache; mounted at `/System/Developer`. Refused to mount when an image was already mounted or Developer Mode was off. |
| “Install Local Xcode DDI Cryptex” | `local_ddi.py`: `hdiutil attach -readonly` of `/Library/Developer/CoreDevice/CandidateDDIs/iOS_DDI.dmg`, then `pymobiledevice3 cryptex auto-install --restore-dir …/Restore` (personalized Cryptex install through the RemoteXPC `cryptexd` service), then detach. |
| Unmount | `mounter umount-personalized` (`/System/Developer`) or `cryptex uninstall com.apple.MobileAsset.DDI`. |
| Status | `mounter list`, `mounter lookup`, `query-developer-mode-status`, `query-nonce`, `query-personalization-identifiers`; Capability Matrix row “developer-image” from `mounter list`. |

### 8.2 Gaps found in the Swift app (before this work)

| # | Gap |
|---|---|
| G1 | No native detection of the mounted image (`LookupImage`) or of its compatibility; state came only from CoreDevice. |
| G2 | Chip ID, board ID, and ECID (needed to select and personalize an image) were never read. |
| G3 | No native iOS 17+ personalized mount (manifest reuse, TSS personalization, upload, mount). Only `devicectl … ddiServices --auto-mount-ddis`, which needs Xcode **and** a CoreDevice-paired device. |
| G4 | No iOS ≤ 16 mount at all. |
| G5 | No “already mounted → do not remount” guard on a native path. |
| G6 | Unmount handled only `/System/Developer`, not the legacy `/Developer`. |
| G7 | No image-state model; the GUI showed only “Available / Not prepared / Needs Xcode”. |
| G8 | Image-mounter errors surfaced as “The image mounter service did not answer”. |
| G9 | Readiness row and `idt ddi` depended on CoreDevice only. |

Not reproduced by design: downloading Apple's images from the third-party mirror (redistributed Apple binaries — the Swift app uses the images Xcode installs in `/Library/Developer/DeveloperDiskImages`, or a folder the user chooses), and the RemoteXPC Cryptex install (needs a privileged tunnel; `devicectl` covers it).

### 8.3 What the Swift app does now

| Gap | Resolution |
|---|---|
| G1, G5 | `ImageMounter.lookup` (`LookupImage`) and `CopyDevices` decide whether a compatible image is mounted; mounting returns immediately (no upload, no Apple request) when one is. |
| G2 | Facts from lockdown (`ProductVersion`, `BuildVersion`, `ProductType`, `CPUArchitecture`, `HardwareModel`, `ChipID`, `BoardId`, Developer Mode), falling back to the image mounter's personalization identifiers for chip and board. ECID is read only for the signing request and never displayed. |
| G3 | Native personalized mount, as `pymobiledevice3` did: pick the build identity for the chip and board from the image Xcode installs (`/Library/Developer/DeveloperDiskImages/iOS_DDI/Restore`, 140 identities for 24 chip families with Xcode 27) or a user folder; reuse a manifest the device already holds (`QueryPersonalizationManifest`, SHA-384); otherwise `QueryPersonalizationIdentifiers` + `QueryNonce` + Apple TSS over HTTPS; then `ReceiveBytes` and `MountImage` with the trust cache. Alternatively (and by default when CoreDevice can reach the device) Xcode's `devicectl … ddiServices --auto-mount-ddis`. |
| G4 | Native legacy mount of `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg` + `.signature` for the exact iOS `major.minor`, found in any installed Xcode's DeviceSupport folder or a user folder. |
| G6 | Unmount handles `/System/Developer` and `/Developer`. |
| G7 | `DeveloperImageState`: not required, mounted, available, personalization required, missing, incompatible, needs attention (trust, Developer Mode, lock, USB), failed — each with a headline, explanation, next step, and details, shown on the Device page's **Developer image** card. |
| G8 | Image-mounter and TSS replies are classified (locked, Developer Mode off, already mounted, not mounted, signature rejected, unsupported, Apple refused, offline) into plain-language errors; raw replies go only to technical details. |
| G9 | Readiness Check, the Actions catalog, and `idt ddi status|mount|unmount` use the same `DeveloperImageManager`. |

No runtime dependency was added: the image-mounter client uses the existing lockdown stack, and
personalization uses `URLSession`. The private service and the TSS request are isolated in
`Sources/DeviceKit/DeveloperImage` (see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#developer-images)).

### 8.4 Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit and fake-device tests (`DeveloperImageTests`, 14 tests) | ✅ every state; TSS request fields and restore-request rules; reply parsing and Apple's refusal codes; personalized mount end to end (identifiers, nonce, TSS, upload size and signature, trust cache); no remount when mounted; reuse of a stored personalization without contacting Apple; unmount; legacy mount without personalization; Developer Mode off and locked device; identifier fallback; simulators and network-only devices |
| The image Xcode 27 installed on this Mac | ✅ parsed: build identity for iPhone18,1 found, image and trust cache readable, a complete TSS request built |
| Apple's signing endpoint | ✅ `https://gs.apple.com/TSS/controller?action=2` reachable with valid TLS (plain GET, no device data). A real signing request needs a device nonce and was **not** sent |
| App | ✅ Developer image card rendered in Demo Mode at 1180×700 and 900×560 (no overflow); all pages pass `scripts/check-layout.sh`; a UI test checks the card and that demo mounting is blocked |
| `idt ddi` | ✅ `status` (text and JSON, exit codes), `mount`/`unmount` confirmation, hidden `prepare` alias |
| **Physical devices** | ❌ **Not tested.** No iPhone or iPad was connected. Still to verify on hardware: the real image-mounter replies, Apple's acceptance of the TSS request, the mount itself, and error wording on real failures — [docs/PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEST_PROTOCOL.md](docs/PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEST_PROTOCOL.md) Stage 3, steps 1–5 |

Not reproduced: downloading images from the third-party mirror (the app uses Xcode's images or a
folder you choose), and the RemoteXPC Cryptex install (`devicectl` covers it without a privileged
tunnel).

## 9. Full parity audit (against `origin/main`, Python 0.3.4)

Scope: all 40 modules in `ios_developer_toolkit/`, the 253 named GUI controls and 130 user actions
in `app.py`/`gui_pages.py`, the smoke-test button list in `entrypoint.py`, all 49 Command Center
presets, the 17 evidence snapshots and man-page routes in `catalog.py`, the 11 Capability Matrix
rows, every CLI option, workspace-profile fields, shortcuts, and the behaviours asserted in
`tests/`. Classification: **=** equivalent · **🔁** replaced by a better Apple mechanism ·
**◐** partial · **✗** missing · **—** intentionally excluded.

**Outcome.** Every gap found (G1–G13, §9.4) is implemented. Intentionally excluded, with reasons
in §6.1 and the rows below: the DVT file listing and DVT app-state notifications (Apple's private
DTX protocol, reachable on iOS 17+ only through CoreDevice's tunnel), RemoteXPC service browsing
(same tunnel), opening URLs through Web Inspector automation (needs a WebDriver session; Open URL
uses CoreDevice instead), downloading developer images (images come from Xcode or a user folder),
and 0.3.x's shortcuts for the tenth and later pages and focus (⌘0, ⇧⌘E/M/S, ⌘L, ⌘F).
