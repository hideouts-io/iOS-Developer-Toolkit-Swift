# Source availability

Every published release of iOS Developer Toolkit is built from a Git tag in
[this public repository](https://github.com/hideouts-io/iOS-Developer-Toolkit-Swift) by the release
workflow, with a GitHub build-provenance attestation that links the archive to that workflow run
and commit. GitHub provides source archives for each tag, or:

```bash
git clone --branch vVERSION --depth 1 https://github.com/hideouts-io/iOS-Developer-Toolkit-Swift.git
```

The app is written in Swift. Its third-party dependencies are Swift packages resolved from their
public repositories at the exact revisions recorded in [`Package.resolved`](Package.resolved) for
that tag. They are listed with their licenses in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
and in the SPDX SBOM attached to each release. No binary-only third-party code is included.

Optional external tools (MVT, UFADE, idb Companion) are installed and managed by the user and are
not part of the app or its SBOM.
